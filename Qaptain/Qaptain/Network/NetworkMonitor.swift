/// Singleton class responsible for monitoring real-time network connectivity status throughout the application
/// Uses Apple's Network framework to detect connection changes and automatically notify the UI layer
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Continuously monitor internet connectivity using NWPathMonitor
/// - Provide real-time updates to SwiftUI views through @Published properties
/// - Automatically trigger network alerts when connection is lost
/// - Handle connection state transitions and user notifications
///

/// Used throughout the app to ensure users are informed about connectivity issues that may affect their experience
